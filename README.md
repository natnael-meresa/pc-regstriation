# pc-regstriation

pc-rgstriation system is a system i built back when i was in collage for  advanced programing in java course project. the main reason that  motived me to build the system was at that time the university didn't have system to check whether you own that laptop or not. so when ever we where living the campus so they where doing manual check like registering the laptop in huge text book and reading through the list so that we do not take other laptops. it took a while to check one's pc and it was awful experience to be honest.
